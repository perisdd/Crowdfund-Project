Added the html template functionality in both _MyLayout and _MyOldLayout (that is the original _MyLayout) by changing inside 
the <head> the href paths.

Added the folder Content and its subfolders in the root directory which is the wwwroot in order for them to be traceable. 

A second way you could do this would be passing everything you had in the Content folder to the existing css, js and images 
folders inside the wwwroot. After that you should change the href paths inside the <head>.

It works in both of the Layout pages. If you want to view the _MyOldLayout as an html page in browser through the specific 
localhost you change both names in the current _MyLayout and the _MyOldLayout name into _MyLayout.
